    "The reason we chose this project is because of our interest in the March Madness Tournament. We all enjoy watching the tournament every year as it is very exciting to see which college teams in the country will come out on top and be claimed as the best college basketball team. Many people every year always try to predict how the tournament will play out, so we thought why not try to actually do it by using data science. Since the NCAA is always maintaining a substantial amount of statistics on the players and teams, we thought this project would be doable as most of the data is public. Another deciding factor for choosing this project is when we present this project, the tournament will have concluded and we will be able to compare our results to who actually won."

    "The main objective is to look at multiple machine learning models to see which model performs the best in predicting the winners that advance from the round of 64 to the round of 32 and from the round of 32 to the sweet 16. In addition, we will see which model predicts the most correct teams in each round. For example, the model may predict 32 teams to advance from the round of 64 to the round of 32 but not all the 32 predicted teams will be correct. Even if not all the teams are correct if a portion of the teams continue to be correct in each of the rounds of the tournament that will help improve our bracket predictions."

    "For our project, we decided to use three data domains to help predict winners in multiple rounds of the 2024 NCAA men’s March Madness basketball tournament. The categories that we determined were the most essential for this project were the March Madness tournament data, the team statistics, and a power rating. Along with 2024 data we also decided to look at previous basketball seasons, to train our prediction model. The previous seasons we selected were the  2017, 2016, and 2009 seasons. The process of selecting these years was by randomly generating 3 random years between 2008-2023, as the website that holds all of the data we need only has the seasons 2008-present. Each dataset we use is in the form of a large data table on https://barttorvik.com/trank.php#, so all we needed to do was paste the data into an Excel file and convert it to a csv file. Therefore, all of the data we read for our project will be only through csv files.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with three individual data domains for each of the four years. The tournament data contained the winners of each round of the tournament. These columns are our outcomes to predict. The teams data contained data on offensive and defensive efficiencies and turnovers. In total there were 16 statistics for team performance. The barthag column is based off of points per possession and is supposed to calculate the chance of beating a division 1 team. \n"

We reduced the teams data to the 64 teams for each year. When we tried to reduce the teams to 64 we realized that some of the team names had numbers or rankings in their names. We had to get rid of the rankings in the team names to programmatically get the list to 64.

We all enjoy the march madness tournament and were excited to put our data science skills to the test on predicting winners in the tournament. Next, we looked for basketball stats that we could use in our model. Once we had data, we cleaned it so we could look at descriptive statistics and make sure the data was clean and accurate. We needed to do some work to get the data in the format we needed to have training and testing data. Finally, we ran KNN, SVM, decision tree, and logistic regression models to see which predicted the winners the best. It appears that logistic regression, KNN, and SVM all perform similarly but for us SVM performed the best. We were able to predict ………FINISH THIS PART"
